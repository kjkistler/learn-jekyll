# learn-jekyll

Jekyll is written in the Ruby programming language. 

Your computer must understand Ruby if you want to use Jekyll.

You must install the latest Ruby language interpreter for your operating system, found at https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/.

This also installs RubyGems, the package manager for Ruby programs (or Ruby "packages"). (To install Ruby programs, your computer must have a Ruby package manager.)

Run your Windows command prompt and ensure that Ruby was installed:

```
ruby -v
```

Ensure that RubyGems was installed:

```
gem -v
```

Install Jekyll:

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Ensure that Jekyll was installed:

```
jekyll -v
```
